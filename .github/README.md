# 🚀 GitHub Actions Workflows

## Active Workflows

### 1. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** (`simple-deploy.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push to `main` or `develop`, Pull Requests, Manual
- **Purpose**: Build and deploy your React app to GitHub Pages
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Automatic testing before deployment
  - ✅ Retry logic for dependency installation
  - ✅ Staging and production deployments
  - ✅ Clear deployment URLs in output

### 2. **Security Scanning** (`security-scan.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Weekly (Monday 2AM), Push to `main`, Manual
- **Purpose**: Scan for security vulnerabilities
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Trivy vulnerability scanner
  - ✅ Python safety checks
  - ✅ npm audit for frontend
  - ✅ Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository → Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: `gh-pages` (will be created automatically)
4. Folder: `/` (root)

### 2. Repository Permissions
The workflows automatically have the required permissions. No additional setup needed!

### 3. Test the Deployment
1. Push any change to `main` or `develop` branch
2. Check the Actions tab for workflow status
3. Wait 2-3 minutes after successful deployment
4. Visit your app URLs

## 📍 Your App URLs

After successful deployment:
- **Production** (main branch): `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`
- **Staging** (develop branch): `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/staging/`

## 🔍 Local Testing

Run the test script to validate your setup locally:
```bash
./test-pipeline.sh
```

## 🎯 Workflow Behavior

### Pull Requests
- ✅ Build and test the app
- ✅ No deployment (safe for review)
- ✅ Shows build status

### Push to `develop`
- ✅ Build, test, and deploy to staging
- 🌐 Available at: `/staging/` path

### Push to `main`
- ✅ Build, test, and deploy to production
- 🌐 Available at: root domain

### Manual Trigger
- ✅ Use "Run workflow" button in Actions tab
- ✅ Choose any branch to deploy

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version in your code
2. **Dependencies fail**: Push will retry automatically
3. **Page not loading**: Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
4. **404 errors**: Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled

### Debug Steps:
1. Check Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Verify GitHub Pages settings
3. Run `./test-pipeline.sh` locally
4. Check if `gh-pages` branch was created
