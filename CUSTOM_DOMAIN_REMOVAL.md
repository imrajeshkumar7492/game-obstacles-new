# Custom Domain Removal - Complete Instructions

## ‚úÖ Code Changes Completed

The repository code has been successfully updated to prevent custom domain usage and force the default GitHub Pages URL. All code-level configurations now ensure the site will be hosted at:

**https://imrajeshkumar7492.github.io/game-obstacles-new/**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Manual Step

The custom domain `freejobalerts.me` is likely configured in the **GitHub repository settings**, which cannot be removed through code changes. You need to manually remove it:

### Steps to Remove Custom Domain:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/imrajeshkumar7492/game-obstacles-new/settings/pages

2. **Remove Custom Domain**:
   - In the "Custom domain" section, delete `freejobalerts.me`
   - Leave the field empty
   - Click "Save"

3. **Verify Source Settings**:
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch
   - Root folder should be "/ (root)"

4. **Trigger New Deployment**:
   - Go to Actions tab: https://github.com/imrajeshkumar7492/game-obstacles-new/actions
   - Run the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow manually
   - Or push a change to the `main` branch

## üîß What Was Fixed in Code

1. **Enhanced GitHub Workflow**: Explicitly prevents CNAME files and disables custom domain
2. **Added Comprehensive Logging**: Clear feedback about domain configuration
3. **Added Documentation**: Complete deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
4. **Tested Configuration**: Verified build process works correctly

## üéØ Expected Result

After removing the custom domain from repository settings and triggering a new deployment:

- ‚úÖ Site will be available at: `https://imrajeshkumar7492.github.io/game-obstacles-new/`
- ‚úÖ No more custom domain redirection
- ‚úÖ Standard GitHub Pages hosting

## üîç Verification

After making the repository settings change:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Visit: https://imrajeshkumar7492.github.io/game-obstacles-new/
3. Verify the site loads correctly
4. Check that `freejobalerts.me` no longer redirects to your site

**Note**: The code is already 100% configured for default GitHub Pages. The only remaining step is the manual repository settings change described above.
